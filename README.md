# 🚗 Parking Lot Detector (YOLOv8 + Jetson Nano)

This project uses **YOLOv8 image classification** to detect whether a parking space is **empty** or **not empty** based on images. It was trained and run entirely on a **Jetson Nano**.

## ✅ How It Works

1. **Dataset Preparation**
   Images were sorted into two classes: `empty_lot` and `non-empty_lot`, with folders for training and validation.

2. **Training the Model**

   ```bash
   yolo task=classify mode=train model=yolov8n-cls.pt data=dataset epochs=50 imgsz=224
   ```

3. **Validation/Test**

   ```bash
   yolo task=classify mode=val model=runs/classify/train3/weights/best.pt data=dataset
   ```

4. **Prediction on New Images**

   ```bash
   yolo task=classify mode=predict model=runs/classify/train3/weights/best.pt source=/path/to/test/images
   ```

5. **Export the Model (optional)**

   ```bash
   yolo export model=runs/classify/train3/weights/best.pt format=onnx
   ```

## 📸 Results

Training and evaluation results (including `results.png`) are saved in:

```
runs/classify/train3/
```

Predictions from new images will show up in:

```
runs/classify/predict/
```
